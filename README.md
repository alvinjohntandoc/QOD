# QOD

QOD is my first flutter app. I created this for exploring Flutter and Bloc design pattern.
This is very simple app that fetches random qoute from [
They Said So Quotes API](https://quotes.rest) and the quote is changing everyday. I also used this project to explore [Bloc](https://github.com/felangel/bloc) library to separate my presentation from business logic.

  - Bloc Design Pattern
  - Network Request
